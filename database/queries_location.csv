John 1:31,en,"[{""verse_num"": 31, ""text"": ""And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.""}]","1. The main theme of John 1:31 is the role of John the Baptist in preparing the way for Jesus Christ, whom he recognizes as the Messiah despite not knowing him previously.","2. In this passage, John the Baptist emphasizes his purpose for baptizing with water: it is to reveal or make manifest Jesus to Israel. The phrase ""I knew him not"" implies that John did not have a personal relationship with Jesus before this encounter. However, through divine revelation, John understands his mission - to prepare people for the coming of the Messiah by baptizing them. This act of baptism with water symbolizes repentance and purification, foreshadowing the spiritual cleansing that Jesus would bring through his teachings and ultimate sacrifice.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Isaiah 40:3: ""The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."" This verse from the book of Isaiah is a prophecy about a voice crying out in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord. In the New Testament, John the Baptist is identified as the fulfillment of this prophecy (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4-6). The theme of preparation for the coming of the Messiah is shared between these passages.

   - Matthew 3:11: ""I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."" Here, John the Baptist contrasts his water baptism with the future baptism of the Holy Spirit by Jesus. This verse highlights the significance of Jesus' mission and further illustrates John's role in preparing the people for this spiritual transformation.

   - John 1:29: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."" This verse immediately precedes the passage in question and emphasizes John's recognition of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God. This theme of Jesus as the sin-bearer is central to the Christian faith and connects closely with the idea of spiritual cleansing and repentance presented in John 1:31."
John 1:30,en,"[{""verse_num"": 30, ""text"": ""This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.""}]",1. The main theme of John 1:30 is the superiority and preexistence of Jesus Christ over John the Baptist.,"2. In this passage, John the Baptist confirms that Jesus is the one he earlier referred to as ""the one who comes after me"" (NIV), but is actually ""preferred before me"" (NKJV). The Greek word ""proegoumai"" (προηγεῖται) used here implies a sense of priority or precedence. John clarifies this by stating that Jesus was before him, meaning Jesus has a higher status and existed before John. This is consistent with the Christian belief that Jesus is eternal and preexisted all creation (John 1:1-3). John humbly acknowledges his role as a witness to Jesus' ministry and emphasizes that he is not even worthy to untie Jesus' sandals (John 1:27). This passage underscores the deity of Jesus Christ and the subordinate role of John the Baptist in God's plan of salvation.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - John 1:15: ""John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."" (KJV)
     This verse reiterates the theme of Jesus' superiority and preexistence, further emphasizing John's role as a witness to Jesus' ministry.

   - John 1:29: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."" (KJV)
     This verse is thematically related because it also comes from John the Baptist's testimony about Jesus. Here, John identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, highlighting Jesus' redemptive role as the Messiah.

   - Philippians 2:5-6: ""Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God."" (KJV)
     These verses discuss Jesus' preexistence and divinity, which are central themes in John 1:30. They reveal Jesus' equality with God, further emphasizing His superiority over John the Baptist and all creation."
John 1:32,en,"[{""verse_num"": 32, ""text"": ""And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.""}]",1. The main theme of John 1:32 is the confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God through the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. This event signifies the anointing and commissioning of Jesus for His earthly ministry.,"2. A detailed explanation of the meaning and significance:
   This passage describes John the Baptist's testimony regarding the identity of Jesus Christ. John saw the Holy Spirit descending from heaven and resting on Jesus in the form of a dove. This miraculous event served as divine confirmation that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Son of God (Matthew 3:16-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22).

   In biblical symbolism, the dove often represents purity, innocence, and the presence of God (Genesis 8:8-12; Matthew 10:16). The descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove upon Jesus emphasizes His sinless nature and divine anointing for His mission. It also highlights the Trinity, as God the Father speaks, God the Holy Spirit descends, and God the Son stands in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:16-17).

   Furthermore, the phrase ""and it abode upon him"" implies that the Holy Spirit remained with Jesus throughout His earthly ministry, empowering and guiding Him (Isaiah 11:2; Luke 4:1, 14, 18).","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Matthew 3:16-17 - ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.""
      This passage shares similar themes as it describes the same event from Matthew's perspective. It further emphasizes the Trinity and the divine commissioning of Jesus.

   b. Isaiah 11:2 - ""And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.""
      This verse is related because it speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon a person (Jesus), providing wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and fear of the Lord. These qualities were evident in Jesus' teachings and miracles.

   c. Acts 2:1-4 - ""And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.""
      This passage is related because it describes the descent of the Holy Spirit in a different form (tongues of fire), but still with the purpose of empowering and guiding believers for their mission."
John 1:33,en,"[{""verse_num"": 33, ""text"": ""And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.""}]",1. The main theme of this passage is the confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. It also touches on the role of John the Baptist in identifying and preparing the way for Jesus.,"2. In John 1:33, John the Baptist explains how he came to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. He initially states that he did not know Jesus, but was sent to baptize with water. This statement emphasizes John's humility and his understanding of his role in relation to the mission of Jesus.

The significance of this passage lies in the confirmation of Jesus' identity by God the Father. When John saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus, he understood that Jesus was the one who was to baptize with the Holy Spirit. This event marked the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and signified the transfer of God's favor from John the Baptist to Jesus (Matthew 3:13-17).","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Matthew 3:16-17: ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.""

     This passage shares a similar theme, as it describes the same event of the Spirit descending on Jesus and God the Father affirming Jesus' identity as His beloved Son.

   - Acts 1:4-5: ""And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.""

     This verse is related because it refers to the baptism with the Holy Spirit, which Jesus would perform, as John the Baptist had foretold in John 1:33. It emphasizes the continuation of Jesus' mission and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on His followers.

   - John 1:29-30: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.""

     This passage is thematically related, as it shows John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus and recognizing Jesus' divine nature and superiority. It highlights John's role in introducing Jesus to the world and affirming His identity."

This passage emphasizes the importance of declaring what the disciples have seen and heard about Jesus Christ, so others can also have fellowship with them, and more importantly, with the Father and his Son (1 John 1:3). The author writes these things to ensure the readers' joy may be full (1 John 1:4). The message they received is that God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all (1 John 1:5). If one claims to have fellowship with God but walks in darkness, they are lying and not practicing the truth (1 John 1:6). However, if they walk in the light as he is in the light, they have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses them from all sin (1 John 1:7).

Confessing sins is crucial, as acknowledging sin and wrongdoing demonstrates faithfulness and justness, allowing for forgiveness and cleansing from unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). Denying sin or claiming not to sin makes God a liar, implying that his word is not in the person denying their sin (1 John 1:10).","3. Related verses that share similar themes or messages include:

The main theme of this passage from 1 John 1:3 is the fellowship that believers have with God and with each other through the testimony of what they have seen and heard about Jesus Christ.,"2. In this verse, John emphasizes the importance of sharing the gospel message - ""that which we have seen and heard"" - so that others can also experience the fellowship that he and his fellow believers enjoy. The word ""fellowship"" (koinonia in Greek) means a close association or community, and here it refers to a shared spiritual relationship between believers and God. Specifically, John says that their fellowship is ""with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."" This highlights the triune nature of God and the central role of Jesus Christ in the Christian faith. By sharing the gospel message, John invites others to participate in this intimate relationship with God.","3. Related Bible verses include:

a. John 14:23: ""Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."" (NKJV) - This verse shares a similar theme of the close relationship between God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the believer. When a person loves and obeys Jesus, God makes His dwelling with that individual, fostering a deep sense of fellowship.

b. Acts 2:42: ""And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."" (NKJV) - This verse speaks of the early church's dedication to the teachings of the apostles, which included the gospel message. Through their adherence to these teachings, they experienced fellowship with one another and with God, as demonstrated by their regular prayers and participation in the Lord's Supper.

The main theme of this passage is the physical manifestation and tangible evidence of the Word of Life, which is Jesus Christ. The author emphasizes that they have a direct, personal experience with Him.","2. In this passage, the author, traditionally believed to be John the Apostle, stresses the reality and authenticity of the message about Jesus Christ. He asserts that what he is sharing is not based on hearsay or myth but on personal observation and interaction. The phrases ""which we have heard,"" ""which we have seen with our eyes,"" ""which we have looked upon,"" and ""our hands have handled"" highlight the physical nature of their encounters with the Word of Life. This Word of Life refers to Jesus Christ, who is the source of eternal life (John 14:6, 1 John 5:11-12). John affirms that their knowledge of Jesus is not abstract or theoretical but grounded in real-life experiences. This passage underscores the importance of eyewitness testimony in the early Christian church and emphasizes the reliability of the gospel message.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. John 20:24-29 - In this passage, Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, doubts the resurrection of Jesus until he sees and touches the wounds on Jesus' hands and side. Jesus then says, ""Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed"" (John 20:29), highlighting the importance of faith even without tangible evidence. This verse shares a similar theme of physical interaction with Jesus, reinforcing the reliability of the gospel message.
   
   b. Acts 4:20 - In this verse, Peter and John, two of Jesus' disciples, testify before the Sanhedrin, saying, ""For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."" This verse reflects the same emphasis on personal experience and eyewitness testimony found in 1 John 1:1.

   c. 1 John 5:6-8 - This passage states, ""This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are in agreement."" This verse, like 1 John 1:1, emphasizes the physical reality of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and the unity of the Spirit, water (baptism), and blood (death) as evidence of Jesus' divinity."
II John 1:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the offering of divine grace, mercy, and peace to the recipients. It highlights the source of these blessings as God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, emphasizing their unity and the relationship between them. The themes of truth and love are also central to this verse, portraying the essence of God's nature and the foundation of His interactions with humanity.","2. This passage serves as a greeting and a blessing from the author, John, to the recipient of the letter. The offering of grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ highlights the generous and compassionate nature of the Christian God. The title ""Son of the Father"" emphasizes the deity and unique relationship of Jesus Christ with God the Father. The phrase ""in truth and love"" indicates that the blessings come from a God who is defined by truth and love, and these blessings are to be experienced in the context of truth and love.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Ephesians 2:4-5 - ""But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved."" (NIV)
      This passage shares a common theme of grace and mercy, emphasizing the role of God's love in salvation.

   b. Galatians 5:22-23 - ""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law."" (NIV)
      This passage shares the theme of peace and is connected through the mention of love. The fruit of the Spirit, which includes love and peace, highlights the Christian life's foundation in God's character.

   c. I John 4:8 - ""Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."" (NIV)
      This verse relates to the theme of love in II John 1:3, emphasizing that God's very nature is love. Understanding this foundational truth shapes the way believers experience and share grace, mercy, and peace."
Revelation of John 3:1,en,"[{""verse_num"": 1, ""text"": ""And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.""}]","1. The main themes of this passage are divine knowledge, the true state of religious institutions, and the contrast between appearance and reality.","2. In Revelation 3:1, the angel of the church in Sardis is addressed by the one who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. This refers to Jesus Christ, who possesses the fullness of the Holy Spirit and has authority over the seven churches (represented by the seven stars). He states that He knows their works, indicating His all-knowing nature as God. Despite having a reputation for being alive ( having a good name or standing), the church in Sardis is described as dead, implying a lack of spiritual vitality and faithfulness.","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Revelation 2:2-3,9,13,19,23,29; 3:2,8,15-16,22 - These verses are all from the letters to the seven churches in Revelation and share similar themes with the passage in question. They highlight the importance of genuine faithfulness and works, warning against complacency and hypocrisy.

   b. Matthew 7:21-23 - ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'""
      This passage emphasizes the importance of genuine faith and obedience, rather than just relying on one's reputation or religious performance. Jesus warns that merely performing miracles or claiming to act in His name is not enough for salvation. He must truly know us, as seen in the Sardis passage where Jesus reveals that He knows their works and true spiritual condition."

Matthew 2:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.""}]","1. The main theme of Matthew 2:3 is the news of Jesus' birth and its impact on Herod and Jerusalem. This passage highlights the fear and troubling thoughts that arose in Herod due to the prophecy of a new king, challenging his authority.","2. In Matthew 2:3, Herod the king had heard about the birth of Jesus, who was prophesied to be the ""King of the Jews"" (Matthew 2:2). This news troubled Herod and all Jerusalem along with him. The word ""troubled"" in Greek is ""etaraxen"" which means ""deeply disturbed or alarmed."" This passage conveys the fear and uncertainty that the new king's birth brought upon the existing ruler and the people in Jerusalem. Herod's reign was marked by violence and suspicion, making him paranoid about anyone who could potentially threaten his throne.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Matthew 2:1-2- ""Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, 'Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.'""
      These verses set the stage for the passage in question. They introduce the wise men who were searching for the newborn King, causing the insecurity for Herod and the people in Jerusalem.

   b. Matthew 2:16-18 - ""Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: 'A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.'""
      These verses describe the aftermath of the news of Jesus' birth. Herod's fear and anger led him to commit an atrocious act—the slaughter of the innocent children. This passage emphasizes the sinister consequences of Herod's response to the birth of Jesus. It also connects the story to Old Testament prophecy (Jeremiah 31:15), giving deeper meaning to the events.

   c. Luke 1:32-33 - ""He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.""
      These verses from Luke's gospel further elaborate on the prophecy of Jesus' birth and His role as the King. They highlight the idea of an everlasting Kingdom, which contrasts with Herod's earthly and temporary reign, thereby emphasizing the significance of Jesus' birth for all mankind."
Matthew 2:4,en,"[{""verse_num"": 4, ""text"": ""And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the search for the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah, or Christ. It involves the religious authorities of the time - the chief priests and scribes - being consulted about the birth of Jesus.","2. In Matthew 2:4, King Herod gathers the chief priests and scribes to inquire where the Christ was to be born. This signifies Herod's interest in the matter, driven by his intention to kill the newborn King of the Jews (Matthew 2:13-18). The priests and scribes, being knowledgeable in Jewish scriptures, quickly refer to Micah 5:2, which prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

The significance of this passage is twofold. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of scriptural knowledge and understanding among religious leaders. Secondly, it marks the beginning of external forces seeking to harm Jesus, ultimately fulfilling the prophecy of His sacrificial death for mankind's sins (Isaiah 53:3-5).","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Micah 5:2: ""But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."" This verse is directly quoted by the chief priests and scribes in response to Herod's question, affirming Jesus as the prophesied Messiah.

   b. Isaiah 9:6-7: ""For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forevermore."" This passage further illustrates the prophetic nature of Jesus' birth, emphasizing His divine nature and role as a ruler.

   c. Luke 2:8-14: ""And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.' Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.'""
