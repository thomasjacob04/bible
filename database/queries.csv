John 1:31,en,"[{""verse_num"": 31, ""text"": ""And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.""}]","1. The main theme of John 1:31 is the role of John the Baptist in preparing the way for Jesus Christ, whom he recognizes as the Messiah despite not knowing him previously.","2. In this passage, John the Baptist emphasizes his purpose for baptizing with water: it is to reveal or make manifest Jesus to Israel. The phrase ""I knew him not"" implies that John did not have a personal relationship with Jesus before this encounter. However, through divine revelation, John understands his mission - to prepare people for the coming of the Messiah by baptizing them. This act of baptism with water symbolizes repentance and purification, foreshadowing the spiritual cleansing that Jesus would bring through his teachings and ultimate sacrifice.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Isaiah 40:3: ""The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God."" This verse from the book of Isaiah is a prophecy about a voice crying out in the wilderness to prepare the way for the Lord. In the New Testament, John the Baptist is identified as the fulfillment of this prophecy (Matthew 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4-6). The theme of preparation for the coming of the Messiah is shared between these passages.

   - Matthew 3:11: ""I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire."" Here, John the Baptist contrasts his water baptism with the future baptism of the Holy Spirit by Jesus. This verse highlights the significance of Jesus' mission and further illustrates John's role in preparing the people for this spiritual transformation.

   - John 1:29: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."" This verse immediately precedes the passage in question and emphasizes John's recognition of Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God. This theme of Jesus as the sin-bearer is central to the Christian faith and connects closely with the idea of spiritual cleansing and repentance presented in John 1:31."
John 1:30,en,"[{""verse_num"": 30, ""text"": ""This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.""}]",1. The main theme of John 1:30 is the superiority and preexistence of Jesus Christ over John the Baptist.,"2. In this passage, John the Baptist confirms that Jesus is the one he earlier referred to as ""the one who comes after me"" (NIV), but is actually ""preferred before me"" (NKJV). The Greek word ""proegoumai"" (προηγεῖται) used here implies a sense of priority or precedence. John clarifies this by stating that Jesus was before him, meaning Jesus has a higher status and existed before John. This is consistent with the Christian belief that Jesus is eternal and preexisted all creation (John 1:1-3). John humbly acknowledges his role as a witness to Jesus' ministry and emphasizes that he is not even worthy to untie Jesus' sandals (John 1:27). This passage underscores the deity of Jesus Christ and the subordinate role of John the Baptist in God's plan of salvation.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - John 1:15: ""John bore witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me."" (KJV)
     This verse reiterates the theme of Jesus' superiority and preexistence, further emphasizing John's role as a witness to Jesus' ministry.

   - John 1:29: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world."" (KJV)
     This verse is thematically related because it also comes from John the Baptist's testimony about Jesus. Here, John identifies Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, highlighting Jesus' redemptive role as the Messiah.

   - Philippians 2:5-6: ""Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God."" (KJV)
     These verses discuss Jesus' preexistence and divinity, which are central themes in John 1:30. They reveal Jesus' equality with God, further emphasizing His superiority over John the Baptist and all creation."
John 1:32,en,"[{""verse_num"": 32, ""text"": ""And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.""}]",1. The main theme of John 1:32 is the confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God through the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove. This event signifies the anointing and commissioning of Jesus for His earthly ministry.,"2. A detailed explanation of the meaning and significance:
   This passage describes John the Baptist's testimony regarding the identity of Jesus Christ. John saw the Holy Spirit descending from heaven and resting on Jesus in the form of a dove. This miraculous event served as divine confirmation that Jesus was indeed the Messiah, the Son of God (Matthew 3:16-17; Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22).

   In biblical symbolism, the dove often represents purity, innocence, and the presence of God (Genesis 8:8-12; Matthew 10:16). The descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove upon Jesus emphasizes His sinless nature and divine anointing for His mission. It also highlights the Trinity, as God the Father speaks, God the Holy Spirit descends, and God the Son stands in the Jordan River (Matthew 3:16-17).

   Furthermore, the phrase ""and it abode upon him"" implies that the Holy Spirit remained with Jesus throughout His earthly ministry, empowering and guiding Him (Isaiah 11:2; Luke 4:1, 14, 18).","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Matthew 3:16-17 - ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.""
      This passage shares similar themes as it describes the same event from Matthew's perspective. It further emphasizes the Trinity and the divine commissioning of Jesus.

   b. Isaiah 11:2 - ""And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.""
      This verse is related because it speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon a person (Jesus), providing wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, and fear of the Lord. These qualities were evident in Jesus' teachings and miracles.

   c. Acts 2:1-4 - ""And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.""
      This passage is related because it describes the descent of the Holy Spirit in a different form (tongues of fire), but still with the purpose of empowering and guiding believers for their mission."
John 1:33,en,"[{""verse_num"": 33, ""text"": ""And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.""}]",1. The main theme of this passage is the confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Son of God and the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. It also touches on the role of John the Baptist in identifying and preparing the way for Jesus.,"2. In John 1:33, John the Baptist explains how he came to recognize Jesus as the Messiah. He initially states that he did not know Jesus, but was sent to baptize with water. This statement emphasizes John's humility and his understanding of his role in relation to the mission of Jesus.

The significance of this passage lies in the confirmation of Jesus' identity by God the Father. When John saw the Spirit descending and remaining on Jesus, he understood that Jesus was the one who was to baptize with the Holy Spirit. This event marked the beginning of Jesus' public ministry and signified the transfer of God's favor from John the Baptist to Jesus (Matthew 3:13-17).","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Matthew 3:16-17: ""And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.""

     This passage shares a similar theme, as it describes the same event of the Spirit descending on Jesus and God the Father affirming Jesus' identity as His beloved Son.

   - Acts 1:4-5: ""And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me. For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.""

     This verse is related because it refers to the baptism with the Holy Spirit, which Jesus would perform, as John the Baptist had foretold in John 1:33. It emphasizes the continuation of Jesus' mission and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on His followers.

   - John 1:29-30: ""The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.""

     This passage is thematically related, as it shows John the Baptist preparing the way for Jesus and recognizing Jesus' divine nature and superiority. It highlights John's role in introducing Jesus to the world and affirming His identity."

This passage emphasizes the importance of declaring what the disciples have seen and heard about Jesus Christ, so others can also have fellowship with them, and more importantly, with the Father and his Son (1 John 1:3). The author writes these things to ensure the readers' joy may be full (1 John 1:4). The message they received is that God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all (1 John 1:5). If one claims to have fellowship with God but walks in darkness, they are lying and not practicing the truth (1 John 1:6). However, if they walk in the light as he is in the light, they have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses them from all sin (1 John 1:7).

Confessing sins is crucial, as acknowledging sin and wrongdoing demonstrates faithfulness and justness, allowing for forgiveness and cleansing from unrighteousness (1 John 1:9). Denying sin or claiming not to sin makes God a liar, implying that his word is not in the person denying their sin (1 John 1:10).","3. Related verses that share similar themes or messages include:

The main theme of this passage from 1 John 1:3 is the fellowship that believers have with God and with each other through the testimony of what they have seen and heard about Jesus Christ.,"2. In this verse, John emphasizes the importance of sharing the gospel message - ""that which we have seen and heard"" - so that others can also experience the fellowship that he and his fellow believers enjoy. The word ""fellowship"" (koinonia in Greek) means a close association or community, and here it refers to a shared spiritual relationship between believers and God. Specifically, John says that their fellowship is ""with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."" This highlights the triune nature of God and the central role of Jesus Christ in the Christian faith. By sharing the gospel message, John invites others to participate in this intimate relationship with God.","3. Related Bible verses include:

a. John 14:23: ""Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him."" (NKJV) - This verse shares a similar theme of the close relationship between God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the believer. When a person loves and obeys Jesus, God makes His dwelling with that individual, fostering a deep sense of fellowship.

b. Acts 2:42: ""And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers."" (NKJV) - This verse speaks of the early church's dedication to the teachings of the apostles, which included the gospel message. Through their adherence to these teachings, they experienced fellowship with one another and with God, as demonstrated by their regular prayers and participation in the Lord's Supper.

The main theme of this passage is the physical manifestation and tangible evidence of the Word of Life, which is Jesus Christ. The author emphasizes that they have a direct, personal experience with Him.","2. In this passage, the author, traditionally believed to be John the Apostle, stresses the reality and authenticity of the message about Jesus Christ. He asserts that what he is sharing is not based on hearsay or myth but on personal observation and interaction. The phrases ""which we have heard,"" ""which we have seen with our eyes,"" ""which we have looked upon,"" and ""our hands have handled"" highlight the physical nature of their encounters with the Word of Life. This Word of Life refers to Jesus Christ, who is the source of eternal life (John 14:6, 1 John 5:11-12). John affirms that their knowledge of Jesus is not abstract or theoretical but grounded in real-life experiences. This passage underscores the importance of eyewitness testimony in the early Christian church and emphasizes the reliability of the gospel message.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. John 20:24-29 - In this passage, Thomas, one of the twelve disciples, doubts the resurrection of Jesus until he sees and touches the wounds on Jesus' hands and side. Jesus then says, ""Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed"" (John 20:29), highlighting the importance of faith even without tangible evidence. This verse shares a similar theme of physical interaction with Jesus, reinforcing the reliability of the gospel message.
   
   b. Acts 4:20 - In this verse, Peter and John, two of Jesus' disciples, testify before the Sanhedrin, saying, ""For we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard."" This verse reflects the same emphasis on personal experience and eyewitness testimony found in 1 John 1:1.

   c. 1 John 5:6-8 - This passage states, ""This is the one who came by water and blood—Jesus Christ. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that testify: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and the three are in agreement."" This verse, like 1 John 1:1, emphasizes the physical reality of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection, and the unity of the Spirit, water (baptism), and blood (death) as evidence of Jesus' divinity."
II John 1:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the offering of divine grace, mercy, and peace to the recipients. It highlights the source of these blessings as God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, emphasizing their unity and the relationship between them. The themes of truth and love are also central to this verse, portraying the essence of God's nature and the foundation of His interactions with humanity.","2. This passage serves as a greeting and a blessing from the author, John, to the recipient of the letter. The offering of grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Jesus Christ highlights the generous and compassionate nature of the Christian God. The title ""Son of the Father"" emphasizes the deity and unique relationship of Jesus Christ with God the Father. The phrase ""in truth and love"" indicates that the blessings come from a God who is defined by truth and love, and these blessings are to be experienced in the context of truth and love.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Ephesians 2:4-5 - ""But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions—it is by grace you have been saved."" (NIV)
      This passage shares a common theme of grace and mercy, emphasizing the role of God's love in salvation.

   b. Galatians 5:22-23 - ""But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law."" (NIV)
      This passage shares the theme of peace and is connected through the mention of love. The fruit of the Spirit, which includes love and peace, highlights the Christian life's foundation in God's character.

   c. I John 4:8 - ""Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love."" (NIV)
      This verse relates to the theme of love in II John 1:3, emphasizing that God's very nature is love. Understanding this foundational truth shapes the way believers experience and share grace, mercy, and peace."
Revelation of John 3:1,en,"[{""verse_num"": 1, ""text"": ""And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest, and art dead.""}]","1. The main themes of this passage are divine knowledge, the true state of religious institutions, and the contrast between appearance and reality.","2. In Revelation 3:1, the angel of the church in Sardis is addressed by the one who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. This refers to Jesus Christ, who possesses the fullness of the Holy Spirit and has authority over the seven churches (represented by the seven stars). He states that He knows their works, indicating His all-knowing nature as God. Despite having a reputation for being alive ( having a good name or standing), the church in Sardis is described as dead, implying a lack of spiritual vitality and faithfulness.","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Revelation 2:2-3,9,13,19,23,29; 3:2,8,15-16,22 - These verses are all from the letters to the seven churches in Revelation and share similar themes with the passage in question. They highlight the importance of genuine faithfulness and works, warning against complacency and hypocrisy.

   b. Matthew 7:21-23 - ""Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'""
      This passage emphasizes the importance of genuine faith and obedience, rather than just relying on one's reputation or religious performance. Jesus warns that merely performing miracles or claiming to act in His name is not enough for salvation. He must truly know us, as seen in the Sardis passage where Jesus reveals that He knows their works and true spiritual condition."

Matthew 2:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.""}]","1. The main theme of Matthew 2:3 is the news of Jesus' birth and its impact on Herod and Jerusalem. This passage highlights the fear and troubling thoughts that arose in Herod due to the prophecy of a new king, challenging his authority.","2. In Matthew 2:3, Herod the king had heard about the birth of Jesus, who was prophesied to be the ""King of the Jews"" (Matthew 2:2). This news troubled Herod and all Jerusalem along with him. The word ""troubled"" in Greek is ""etaraxen"" which means ""deeply disturbed or alarmed."" This passage conveys the fear and uncertainty that the new king's birth brought upon the existing ruler and the people in Jerusalem. Herod's reign was marked by violence and suspicion, making him paranoid about anyone who could potentially threaten his throne.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Matthew 2:1-2- ""Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying, 'Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him.'""
      These verses set the stage for the passage in question. They introduce the wise men who were searching for the newborn King, causing the insecurity for Herod and the people in Jerusalem.

   b. Matthew 2:16-18 - ""Then Herod, when he saw that he was deceived by the wise men, was exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children who were in Bethlehem and all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying: 'A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.'""
      These verses describe the aftermath of the news of Jesus' birth. Herod's fear and anger led him to commit an atrocious act—the slaughter of the innocent children. This passage emphasizes the sinister consequences of Herod's response to the birth of Jesus. It also connects the story to Old Testament prophecy (Jeremiah 31:15), giving deeper meaning to the events.

   c. Luke 1:32-33 - ""He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.""
      These verses from Luke's gospel further elaborate on the prophecy of Jesus' birth and His role as the King. They highlight the idea of an everlasting Kingdom, which contrasts with Herod's earthly and temporary reign, thereby emphasizing the significance of Jesus' birth for all mankind."
Matthew 2:4,en,"[{""verse_num"": 4, ""text"": ""And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the search for the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah, or Christ. It involves the religious authorities of the time - the chief priests and scribes - being consulted about the birth of Jesus.","2. In Matthew 2:4, King Herod gathers the chief priests and scribes to inquire where the Christ was to be born. This signifies Herod's interest in the matter, driven by his intention to kill the newborn King of the Jews (Matthew 2:13-18). The priests and scribes, being knowledgeable in Jewish scriptures, quickly refer to Micah 5:2, which prophesied that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

The significance of this passage is twofold. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of scriptural knowledge and understanding among religious leaders. Secondly, it marks the beginning of external forces seeking to harm Jesus, ultimately fulfilling the prophecy of His sacrificial death for mankind's sins (Isaiah 53:3-5).","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Micah 5:2: ""But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times."" This verse is directly quoted by the chief priests and scribes in response to Herod's question, affirming Jesus as the prophesied Messiah.

   b. Isaiah 9:6-7: ""For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the greatness of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David’s throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forevermore."" This passage further illustrates the prophetic nature of Jesus' birth, emphasizing His divine nature and role as a ruler.

   c. Luke 2:8-14: ""And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.' Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.'""

In this passage, the chief priests and scribes are explaining to King Herod where the Messiah (Jesus) is to be born, based on Micah 5:2.

      This verse is the original prophecy the priests and scribes reference, revealing the significance of Jesus' birth in Bethlehem and confirming His divine nature and destiny as the ruler of Israel.

   b. Luke 2:4-7 (NIV): ""So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.""
      This passage from Luke's gospel describes Jesus' birth in Bethlehem, connecting the prophecy with its fulfillment. It highlights the humble circumstances of Jesus' birth, further emphasizing the significance of the prophecy and the divine plan for the Messiah.

   c. John 7:42 (NIV): ""Does not Scripture say that the Messiah will come from David's family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived?""

John 2:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is faith and dependence on God, as well as the beginning of Jesus' miraculous ministry.","2. In John 2:3, the wedding feast at Cana has run out of wine, an important element in Jewish wedding celebrations. Mary, the mother of Jesus, brings this need to her son's attention, thus demonstrating her faith that He can do something about it. Jesus' response, ""Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come"" (John 2:4 KJV), might seem dismissive, but He is actually preparing to perform His first public miracle. When Mary tells the servants to ""do whatever he tells you"" (John 2:5 NIV), she shows trust and obedience. Jesus then turns water into wine, a sign of His divine power and the beginning of His miracles that reveal His glory (John 2:11).","3. Related Bible verses and their explanations:

In this passage, the Lord (Yahweh) is depicted as leaving His holy dwelling place to come down to the earth. This imagery conveys the idea that God is actively involved in human affairs and will not ignore the sin and rebellion of His people. Treading upon the high places of the earth signifies God's authority over all creation, including the most exalted and powerful individuals or institutions. Moreover, it indicates that God will judge the sin committed in those elevated places, likely referring to the sins of the arrogant and the proud.","3.

In Micah 1:5, the prophet identifies the ""transgression of Jacob"" as Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel. The ""high places of Judah"" are equated with Jerusalem, the capital of the southern kingdom. Micah is emphasizing that the sins of the entire nation, both the northern and southern kingdoms, have brought about divine judgment.

The ""transgression of Jacob"" refers to the collective disobedience and sinfulness of the descendants of Jacob, which is another name for Israel. By connecting this transgression to Samaria, Micah highlights the role of the northern kingdom's idolatry and sinfulness in inviting judgment.

The ""high places of Judah"" were locations where the Israelites practiced idolatrous worship, often involving child sacrifice. Micah associates these high places with Jerusalem, indicating that the southern kingdom is also complicit in the nation's sin.","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Isaiah 1:21-23 (NIV): ""See how the faithful city has become a prostitute! She once was full of justice; righteousness used to dwell in her— but now murderers! Your silver has become dross, your choice wine is diluted with water. Your leaders are rebels, companions of thieves; they all love bribes and chase after gifts. They do not defend the cause of the fatherless; the widow's case does not come before them.""

      This passage from Isaiah shares a similar theme of a city's sinfulness and the consequences that follow. Here, the prophet Isaiah criticizes Jerusalem for its moral decay, idolatry, and injustice.

   b. Jeremiah 3:6-7 (NIV): ""During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, ‘Have you seen what faithless Israel has done? She has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there. I thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it.'""

      In this passage from Jeremiah, the prophet compares the sins of the northern kingdom (Israel) with those of the southern kingdom (Judah). Both kingdoms are guilty of idolatry and unfaithfulness, similar to the transgressions highlighted in Micah 1:5.

   c. Hosea 4:15 (NIV): ""Though you, Israel, commit adultery, do not let Judah become guilty. Do not go to Gilgal, do not go up to Beth Aven, and do not swear, ‘As surely as the Lord lives.’""

      This verse from Hosea warns the Israelites against following in the footsteps of their ancestors, who committed idolatry and adultery. Gilgal and Beth Aven are associated with idol worship, similar to the ""high places"" mentioned in Micah 1:5."
Micah 1:6,en,"[{""verse_num"": 6, ""text"": ""Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage from Micah 1:6 is the impending judgment and destruction of Samaria, the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel.","2. In this verse, the Lord declares that He will turn Samaria into a pile of ruins, comparable to a neglected field or a vineyard with uprooted plants. The stones and foundations of the city will be exposed and discarded in the valley. This vivid imagery conveys the complete devastation and desolation of Samaria due to its sin and rebellion against God. The Lord's patience has run out, and He will bring judgment upon the city and its inhabitants.","3. Related Bible verses that share similar themes or messages include:

   a. Isaiah 28:1-4 - ""Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine! Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet: and the fading flower, the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be as a first-ripe fig before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.""

      This passage from Isaiah also speaks of the Lord's judgment on the northern kingdom of Israel, comparing the proud and sinful inhabitants to a fading flower that will be destroyed.

   b. Jeremiah 4:6-7 - ""Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.""

      This passage from Jeremiah shares a similar theme of the Lord's judgment and devastation of the land and cities due to the people's sins and rebellion."
Matthew 24:27,en,"[{""verse_num"": 27, ""text"": ""For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.""}]","1. The main theme of Matthew 24:27 is the second coming of Jesus Christ, depicted as an event that will be visible to all people, just like lightning that illuminates the entire sky.","2. This passage emphasizes the global and spectacular nature of Jesus' second coming. When He returns, it will not be a quiet or hidden event but rather something as dramatic and noticeable as lightning that streaks across the sky from east to west. In the ancient world, lightning was often associated with divine intervention or theophanies. Here, Jesus uses this imagery to underline the extraordinary and world-changing character of His return. It is a promise of hope and assurance for His followers that His coming will bring about salvation and judgment.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Matthew 24:30: ""Then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven. And then all the peoples of the earth will mourn when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory.""

The themes of visibility, global impact, and divine glory are shared between the two verses.
   
   b. Revelation 1:7: ""Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him; and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen.""

Mark 13:28,en,"[{""verse_num"": 28, ""text"": ""Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:""}]",1. The main theme of this passage is the concept of watching for signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God.,"2. In Mark 13:28, Jesus uses the example of a fig tree to illustrate this theme. When the branch of a fig tree is still tender and begins to put forth leaves, it is a clear sign that summer is near. Similarly, when we see certain signs in the world around us, we can know that the coming of the Kingdom of God is near.

The fig tree was a common symbol in Jewish teaching and was often used to represent Israel. In this passage, Jesus may be using the fig tree as a metaphor for the nation of Israel. The tender branch and leaves could represent the early stages of the restoration of Israel, which was a sign that the coming of the Kingdom of God was near.

This passage emphasizes the importance of being observant and watchful for the signs of the times. It encourages believers to be alert and to recognize the significance of the events that are taking place in the world around them.","3. Related Bible verses that share similar themes or messages include:

- Matthew 24:32-33: ""Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near.

This passage reinforces the message of Mark 13:28 and emphasizes the importance of watching for the signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God.

- Luke 21:29-31: ""He told them this parable: 'Look at the fig tree and all the trees. When they sprout leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near.

This passage also uses the example of a fig tree to teach about the signs of the coming of the Kingdom of God and encourages believers to be observant and watchful."
I Samuel 3:2,en,"[{""verse_num"": 2, ""text"": ""And at that time, when Eli was resting in his place, (now his eyes were becoming clouded so that he was not able to see,)""}]","1. The main themes of this passage from I Samuel 3:2 are aging, loss of sight, and the passing of responsibility. Eli, the high priest, is growing old, and his eyesight is failing, symbolizing the diminishing of his abilities and the impending transition of leadership.","2. This passage highlights the natural process of aging and the challenges that come with it. Eli, once a strong and capable leader, is now facing physical limitations as his eyesight weakens. This physical decline is a metaphor for the fading of his spiritual leadership and the need for a new generation to take up the mantle. The passage emphasizes the importance of recognizing and preparing for generational shifts in leadership and responsibility.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. II Samuel 19:35 - ""I am now old and stricken in years; and you know that I am not able to go out or come in."" - This verse, spoken by Barzillai to King David, echoes the theme of aging and the limitations that come with it. Barzillai, like Eli, recognizes his own physical decline and humbly steps aside, acknowledging the need for younger, more capable leaders.

   b. Proverbs 16:31 - ""Gray hair is a crown of splendor; it is attained in the way of righteousness."" - This verse offers a contrasting perspective, reminding us that aging can also be a symbol of wisdom, experience, and righteousness. While Eli's eyesight is failing, his years of service and dedication to God are a testament to his spiritual leadership and righteousness.

   c. Isaiah 46:4 - ""Even to your old age I am He, and even to gray hairs I will carry you! I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you."" - This verse speaks to God's unchanging nature and His commitment to His people, regardless of their age or physical condition. Despite Eli's declining abilities, God remains a constant source of support and guidance."
I Samuel 3:3,en,"[{""verse_num"": 3, ""text"": ""And the light of God was still burning, while Samuel was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord where the ark of God was,""}]",1. The main theme of this passage is God's presence and communication with His people. This is depicted through the symbol of the light of God still burning and Samuel's ability to hear God's voice in his sleep.,"2. In I Samuel 3:3, the light of God refers to the menorah, a seven-branched candelabrum that was always kept burning in the sanctuary of the Tabernacle and later in the Temple (Exodus 27:20-21). This signified God's continuous presence among His people. Samuel, a young boy at this time, was sleeping in the Temple of the Lord, near the Ark of God, which contained the Ten Commandments and represented God's throne on earth (Exodus 25:10-22). This setting highlights the significance of this moment - God choosing to communicate directly with Samuel in the holy sanctuary.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   a. Exodus 25:30: ""You shall set the lampstand before the veil that is by the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, which I will make."" - This verse further emphasizes the importance of the menorah as a symbol of God's presence and the sacredness of the area where Samuel slept.

   b. I Kings 8:10-11: ""And it came to pass, when the priests had come out of the holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the Lord, so that the priests could not continue ministering because of the cloud; for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord."" - This passage illustrates another occasion where God's presence is strongly felt, as a cloud fills Solomon's Temple during its dedication.

   c. Isaiah 6:1-3: ""In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew."" - Here, the prophet Isaiah encounters God in the temple, similar to Samuel, highlighting the theme of God's communication with His people in holy places."

The main themes of this passage are the true nature of Jewish identity and the inadequacy of mere external observance of the law.,"2. In Romans 2:25-40, Paul argues that circumcision, a key sign of Jewish identity, is only valuable if it is accompanied by obedience to God's law. If a person breaks the law, their circumcision is as if it did not exist. Conversely, those who are not physically circumcised but still obey God's law will be regarded as if they were circumcised. The true Jew, Paul says, is not one who is outwardly Jewish but one whose heart is circumcised, that is, one who is spiritually transformed and obedient to God. This person's praise comes from God, not from other people. Paul is challenging his Jewish audience to look beyond outward appearances and to consider the true state of their hearts. He is also implying that Gentiles who obey God's law will be judged favorably.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Galatians 6:15: ""For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything; what matters is a new creation."" Here, Paul makes a similar argument to the one in Romans 2. He says that what really matters is not outward signs of religious identity but a new inner life that comes from faith in Christ.
   
   - Deuteronomy 10:16: ""Circumcise your hearts, therefore, and do not be stiff-necked any longer."" This Old Testament passage encourages the Israelites to circumcise their hearts, that is, to turn away from their sinful ways and to obey God wholeheartedly. This is consistent with Paul's emphasis on the inner, spiritual dimension of circumcision.
   
   - Colossians 2:11: ""In him you were also circumcised with a circumcision not performed by human hands. Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off when you were circumcised by Christ."" Here, Paul describes how believers in Christ have been spiritually circumcised. This spiritual circumcision is a result of their faith in Christ and their identification with him. Again, Paul is focusing on the inner, spiritual reality rather than outward signs."
John 3:15,en,"[{""verse_num"": 15, ""text"": ""So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life.""}]",1. The main theme of this passage is salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.,"2.

Jesus has just explained to Nicodemus that he must be born again through water and the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God (John 3:3-8). Now, he clarifies that having faith in him is the key to receiving eternal life. This passage underlines the importance of faith in Jesus as the path to eternal life and salvation.","3.

John 3:15,en,"[{""verse_num"": 15, ""text"": ""So that whoever has faith may have in him eternal life.""}]",1. The main theme of John 3:15 is the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.,"2. In this passage, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus about the necessity of being born again through water and the Spirit to enter the kingdom of God (John 3:3-5). He then explains that just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, so that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him (John 3:14-15). This passage highlights the significance of faith in Jesus as the means to obtain eternal life. The image of Moses lifting up the serpent in the wilderness comes from Numbers 21:4-9, where God instructs Moses to create a bronze serpent and lift it up on a pole so that anyone bitten by a serpent could look at it and live. In the same way, Jesus would be lifted up on the cross, and those who look to Him in faith will receive the gift of eternal life.","3. Related Bible verses include:

Genesis 3:15,en,"[{""verse_num"": 15, ""text"": ""And there will be war between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed: by him will your head be crushed and by you his foot will be wounded.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the promise of a future conflict between the serpent (often interpreted as Satan) and the woman, with the woman's offspring ultimately triumphing.","2. In Genesis 3:15, God curses the serpent after the fall of Adam and Eve. The verse predicts a future battle between the serpent's offspring and the woman's offspring. This prophecy is significant because it introduces the hope of salvation and victory over sin and evil through the woman's seed. This promise ultimately finds its fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who was born of a woman (Galatians 4:4) and through His death and resurrection, defeated Satan (Hebrews 2:14-15). Although the woman's seed will suffer wounds, it will ultimately crush the serpent's head, signifying a decisive and fatal blow.","3. Related Bible verses:

   a. Isaiah 7:14 - ""Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel."" (NIV)
      This verse shares the theme of a significant figure being born of a woman. Immanuel, meaning ""God with us,"" is a prophecy of Jesus' birth, who would later fulfill the Genesis 3:15 promise by defeating Satan.

   b. Romans 16:20 - ""The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet."" (NIV)
      This verse echoes the Genesis 3:15 promise, reinforcing the idea that Satan's ultimate defeat will come at the hands of God's people.

   c. Revelation 12:7-9 - ""Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him."" (NIV)
      This passage from Revelation describes the final conflict between God's forces and Satan. The imagery of the serpent being cast down from heaven and defeated reinforces the Genesis 3:15 promise that the woman's offspring will ultimately defeat Satan."
Genesis 3:11,en,"[{""verse_num"": 11, ""text"": ""And he said, Who gave you the knowledge that you were without clothing? Have you taken of the fruit of the tree which I said you were not to take?""}]","1. The main themes of this passage are disobedience, shame, and guilt.","2. In Genesis 3:11, God is questioning Adam after he and Eve have eaten the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge. God first asks about their newfound awareness of their nakedness, which indicates that they have gained knowledge that they were previously innocent of. This signifies a transition from innocence to consciousness of good and evil.

   Then, God asks about the fruit of the forbidden tree. Adam's response shows that he is aware of his disobedience, and it suggests that the knowledge they gained from eating the fruit also includes an understanding of the consequences of their actions. This event marks the entry of sin into the world and the separation of humanity from God.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Romans 5:12: ""Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all people, because all sinned."" This verse expands on the consequences of Adam and Eve's disobedience, explaining that it brought sin and death into the world.

   - Romans 3:23: ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" This verse highlights the theme of universal sinfulness, which can be traced back to Adam and Eve's original sin in the Garden of Eden.

   - 1 Corinthians 15:22: ""For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive."" This verse presents Christ as the counterbalance to Adam. Just as all people die because of Adam's sin, all will be made alive through Christ's redemptive work."
Genesis 3:12,en,"[{""verse_num"": 12, ""text"": ""And the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me the fruit of the tree and I took it.""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is responsibility and blame shifting. Adam, the first man, attributes his disobedience to God's decision to give him a wife and to the woman's deception.","2. In Genesis 3:12, Adam fails to take responsibility for his actions. Instead of acknowledging his own decision to eat the forbidden fruit, he blames both God and his wife. This passage demonstrates the human tendency to avoid accountability, a trait that has persisted since the fall of man. Adam's response highlights the reality of sin's entrance into the world and its consequences, including guilt, shame, and broken relationships.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Genesis 3:9: ""But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, 'Where are you?'"" (ESV) - This verse shows God's pursuit of mankind even after their disobedience, reflecting His unchanging love and mercy.

   - Romans 5:12: ""Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned"" - This verse parallels the consequences of Adam's sin in Genesis 3:12 with the broader impact of sin on humanity.

   - James 1:14-15: ""But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.

The main theme of this passage is God's presence and guidance with Moses in his mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.,"2. In Exodus 3:12, God promises Moses, ""Truly I will be with you..."" This assurance of divine presence is a common theme in Old Testament narratives where individuals are called to carry out challenging tasks for God (e.g., Joshua 1:5, Isaiah 41:10). The sign that God has sent Moses will be the successful delivery of the Israelites to this mountain for worship. This statement emphasizes both the importance of obedience to God's command and the expectation of miraculous intervention. Worshipping God on this mountain (Mount Sinai) becomes significant later in the narrative as it is where Moses receives the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19-20).","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Joshua 1:5: ""No one will be able to stand against you all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will never leave you nor forsake you.""
     This verse reflects a similar promise of God's continuous presence, echoing the theme in Exodus 3:12.

   - Isaiah 43:2: ""When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not set you ablaze.""
     Here, God reaffirms His commitment to protect and accompany His people through trials, similar to Moses' mission in Exodus 3:12.

   - 1 Corinthians 10:4: ""They drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.""
     While from the New Testament, this verse references the Israelites' journey from a Christian perspective, viewing Jesus as the spiritual rock who guided and sustained them, corresponding to God's promise of presence in Exodus 3:12."
John 3:12,en,"[{""verse_num"": 12, ""text"": ""If you have no belief when my words are about the things of earth, how will you have belief if my words are about the things of heaven?""}]","1. The main theme of this passage is the importance of faith and belief in accepting spiritual teachings. It emphasizes that if one finds it difficult to believe in earthly matters, then believing in heavenly things would be even more challenging.","2. In John 3:12, Jesus is speaking to Nicodemus, a Pharisee and member of the Jewish ruling council. He uses an analogy to explain the concept of spiritual rebirth, comparing it to the natural phenomenon of wind. Here, He highlights the necessity of faith, stating that belief is a prerequisite for understanding higher spiritual truths. If someone struggles to believe in earthly teachings, it would be unlikely for them to believe in heavenly things, as they are inherently more abstract and harder to grasp. The significance of this passage lies in its emphasis on faith as a foundation for spiritual growth and understanding.","3. Related Bible verses include:

   - Hebrews 11:1: ""Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."" This verse complements John 3:12 by defining faith as the evidence of unseen things, further emphasizing its importance in accepting spiritual teachings.

It connects to John 3:12 by demonstrating the significance of faith in overcoming obstacles and understanding divine teachings.

   - Romans 10:17: ""So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ."" This verse explains that faith arises from hearing the Word of God. It relates to John 3:12 by emphasizing the role of hearing and accepting God's teachings as a basis for faith and belief."

The Lord is depicted as stepping down from his holy Temple to intervene in human affairs due to the sins of Jacob (a reference to Israel) and the children of Israel. The imagery used is powerful: mountains becoming water, deep valleys breaking open, and idols being destroyed. These are symbols of the Lord's power and wrath against the sins of his people.

The verse is a warning from God to those who are practicing injustice, particularly towards the vulnerable members of society. The ""measuring line"" is a symbol of justice and fair distribution, often used in the context of dividing land (Leviticus 25:10, Deuteronomy 19:14).

He is to wear holy linen garments and wash himself with water before putting them on. The sacrifices he must bring include an ox for a sin-offering, a male sheep for a burned offering, two male goats for a sin-offering, and another male sheep for a burned offering. The two goats for the sin-offering serve a unique purpose: one is a sin-offering for the people, while the other, known as the scapegoat, symbolically carries the sins of the people into the wilderness.

These rituals emphasize the holiness of God and the need for proper atonement for sin. They illustrate the concept of substitutionary atonement, where an animal takes the place of the sinner, bearing the punishment for their wrongdoing.","3. Related Bible verses:
